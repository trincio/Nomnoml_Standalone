#UPDATE
Updated with the released version of nomnoml on march 2024.

# Nomnoml_Standalone
Standalone version of [Nomnoml](https://github.com/skanaar/nomnoml) - Incl. NCBS

# Reason for this pseudofork
1. Demonstrate how [NCBS](https://github.com/trincio/NCBS) works.
2. Provide a standalone fully working Nomnoml App

# Where to use it
Use it if you're an analyst and you need to determine the interactions between the objects you're studying in a easier way and find evidences of correlations or functional or relationals bugs or issues.
Use it to determine in a more schematic way your mental maps and diagram, by writing it down with an easy syntax: after that you'll be able to view the drawing of your map in a clearly understandable fashion, helping then the creativity to push new thoughs.


If you're a developer and need it to draw UML diagrams, maybe you're more interested in the   [original Nomnoml here](https://github.com/skanaar/nomnoml).

# How to install it
1. Download the whole set of files in this repository (easy way: click to the green "code" button in the top right of this page, and select "Download zip")

2. once all the files are in a folder, unzipped, open the index.html in a browser. That's all. Easy as 123.


# How to use it
Mr. Daniel Kallin made a commendable work expecially from the usability and the GUI: once opened the index.html file an example of a diagram, the left side of the screen represents the coding area, where you can type and watch what happens live in the right part of the screen, where the diagram changes as soon as you type the code. On the top right area the menu, whith a very exhaustive help and language reference.

# Brief explanation of what has been done
Got the last version of Nomnoml of 05 nov. 2020, cleanedup unuseful data (typescript etc.), added some libraries (codemirror, react...) and finally the [NCBS](https://github.com/trincio/NCBS) . This way Nomnoml can be run just by downloading it and running the index.html in the browser. That's all. Easy for normal people. Normal people do not want to be asked for installing via npm or other tools, normal people aren't aware about what a crossorigin script is. Normal people wants to work in a easy way.
