# Nomnoml_Standalone
Standalone version of [Nomnoml](https://github.com/skanaar/nomnoml) - Incl. NCBS

# Reason for this pseudofork
1. Demonstrate how does [NCBS](https://github.com/trincio/NCBS) works.
2. Provide a standalone fully working Nomnoml App

# Where to use it
Use it if you're an analyst and you need to determine the interactions between the objects you're studying in a easier way and find evidences of correlations or functional or relationals bugs or issues.
Use it to determine in a more schematic way your mental maps, by writing it down with an easy syntax: after that you'll be able to view the drawing of your map in a clearly understandable fashion, helping then the creativity to push new thoughs.


# Brief explanation of what has been done
Got the last version of Nomnoml of 05 nov. 2020, cleanedup unuseful data (typescript etc.), added some libraries (codemirror, react...) and finally the NCBS. This way Nomnoml can be run just by downloading it and running the index.html in the browser. That's all. Easy for normal people. Normal people do not want to be asked for installing via npm or other tools, normal people aren't aware about what a crossorigin script is. Normal people wants to work in a easy way.
